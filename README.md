# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Nowadays, employee attrition became a serious issue regarding a company’s competitive advantage. It’s very expensive to find, hire and train new talents. It’s more cost-effective to keep the employees a company already has. A company needs to maintain a pleasant working atmosphere to make their employees stay in that company for a longer period. A few years back it was done manually but it is an era of machine learning and data analytics. Now, a company’s HR department uses some data analytics tool to identify which areas to be modified to make most of its employees to stay.

## Need of Employee Attrition prediction
1. __Managing workforce:__ If the supervisors or HR came to know about some employees that they will be planning to leave the company then they could get in touch with those employees which can help them to stay back or they can manage the workforce by hiring the new alternative of those employees.
2. __Smooth pipeline:__ If all the employees in the current project are working continuously on a project then the pipeline of that project will be smooth but if suppose one efficient asset of the project(employee) suddenly leave that company then the workflow will be not so smooth
3. __Hiring Management:__ If HR of one particular project came to know about the employee who is willing to leave the company then he/she can manage the number of hiring and they can get the valuable asset whenever they need so for the efficient flow of work.

## Methodology
Here, I am going to use 5 simple steps to analyze Employee Attrition using Python software
1. DATA COLLECTION
2. DATA PRE PROCESSING
3. DIVIDING THE DATA into TWO PARTS “TRAINING” AND “TESTING”
4. BUILD UP THE MODEL USING “TRAINING DATA SET”
5. DO THE ACCURACY TEST USING “TESTING DATA SET”
