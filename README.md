# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Nowadays, employee attrition became a serious issue regarding a company’s competitive advantage. It’s very expensive to find, hire and train new talents. It’s more cost-effective to keep the employees a company already has. A company needs to maintain a pleasant working atmosphere to make their employees stay in that company for a longer period. A few years back it was done manually but it is an era of machine learning and data analytics. Now, a company’s HR department uses some data analytics tool to identify which areas to be modified to make most of its employees to stay.

## Need of Employee Attrition prediction
1. __Managing workforce:__ If the supervisors or HR came to know about some employees that they will be planning to leave the company then they could get in touch with those employees which can help them to stay back or they can manage the workforce by hiring the new alternative of those employees.
2. __Smooth pipeline:__ If all the employees in the current project are working continuously on a project then the pipeline of that project will be smooth but if suppose one efficient asset of the project(employee) suddenly leave that company then the workflow will be not so smooth
3. __Hiring Management:__ If HR of one particular project came to know about the employee who is willing to leave the company then he/she can manage the number of hiring and they can get the valuable asset whenever they need so for the efficient flow of work.

## Methodology
Here, I am going to use 5 simple steps to analyze Employee Attrition using Python software
1. DATA COLLECTION
2. DATA PRE PROCESSING
3. DIVIDING THE DATA into TWO PARTS “TRAINING” AND “TESTING”
4. BUILD UP THE MODEL USING “TRAINING DATA SET”
5. DO THE ACCURACY TEST USING “TESTING DATA SET”


## Requirements
Dependency requirements for the analysis of employee attrition prediction:

1. __Python 3.x:__ Python is the programming language used for data analysis and model development.
2. __pandas:__ This library is used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling structured data.
3. __scikit-learn:__ Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
4. __XGBoost:__ XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library designed for efficiency, speed, and performance.
5. __TensorFlow and Keras:__ These libraries are used for building and training neural network models.
6. __matplotlib and seaborn:__ These libraries are used for data visualization to gain insights from the data.

You can install these dependencies using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following commands:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```
Make sure to replace tensorflow with tensorflow-cpu if you want to install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow to reduce installation size and avoid potential compatibility issues with GPU drivers.

## How to run project
* First install the above libraries mentioned in the Requirements.
* If you want to run the __Ibm_Employee_Attrition.py__ just run the following command in terminal:
```bash
python run Ibm_Employee_Attrition.py
```
* If you want to run the __Ibm_employee_attrition.ipynb__ just click on the __Run All__ button in vs code.
